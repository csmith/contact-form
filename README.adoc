= Go contact form

== About

Provides a simple, tiny webservice that serves a contact form and sends responses
via e-mail.

image:example-form.png[Example contact form] ->
image:example-email.png[Example email message]

== Usage

The simplest way to use this is via docker. See the `examples` directory for some
example docker-compose files. The latest stable version of this project is published
at `ghcr.io/csmith/contact-form:latest`.

You should place this service behind an TLS-terminating proxy such as Caddy or Traefik,
and ensure it is requested over a secure connection.

== Parameters

The application can be configured either using command line arguments
or environmental variables (shown in square brackets, below).
_from_, _to_, _smtp-host_, _smtp-user_, and _smtp-pass_ are required;
other options have vaguely sensible fallbacks.

----

You can use any SMTP server; however I recommend using a dedicated service
such as https://www.mailgun.com/[mailgun] or
https://aws.amazon.com/ses/[AWS SES], both of which you can access over SMTP.

== Templates

All templates are loaded from the `templates` directory, which is expected to
be in the current working directory. The form itself is loaded from `form.html`;
success and failure pages from `success.html` and `failure.html` respectively.
If captcha support is enabled, the captcha page is loaded from `captcha.html`.
Each page is loaded as a https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/[go html.template] and
can use the templating syntax described there.

Any query parameters passed to the form will be accessible through the `{{ .params }}` template field. The
default template will include all parameters as hidden fields in the form.

If the form contains a field named `from`, it will be used in the `Reply-To` header,
and included in log messages to help trace issues. Otherwise, no
special processing is applied to any field; they are all simply written out to the message body.
No server-side validation is performed.

When running from the docker image, templates are stored in `/templates`; you can
replace this with a volume to supply custom templates.

== Static files

Any files in the `static` directory will be served under the path `/static/`.
By default that is just a single stylesheet (`style.css`) that is used by the
default templates.

When running from the docker image, static files are stored in `/static`; you can
replace this with a volume to supply custom files.

== OOPSpam

Optional https://www.oopspam.com/[OOPSpam] integration can be enabled by setting
the `oopspam-apikey` flag (or `CONTACT_OOPSPAM_APIKEY` env var). By default if
the request to OOPSpam fails (e.g. because of server issues, or exceeding the
rate limits) the contact attempt will be failed. You can change this with the
`oopspam-error-handler` flag (or `CONTACT_OOPSPAM_ERROR_HANDLER` env var):
`allow` will just send the message, `captcha` will present a captcha challenge.

Messages with a score greater than or equal to 3 are considered spam, and
the behaviour in the `oopspam-spam-handler` flag (or
`CONTACT_OOPSPAM_SPAM_HANDLER` env var) will determine what happens next. The
default behaviour is to deny the request.

The `enable-captcha` setting is ignored if OOPSpam is enabled. Captchas will
be presented if the error handler or spam handler has the value `captcha`
otherwise they won't be.

If present, the `X-Forwarded-For` header will be used to determine the client's
IP address. This is not validated in any way. It is assumed that the contact
for is hosted behind a TLS-terminating proxy that will ensure this header is
passed on with valid data.

== Health checks

If the `-enable-health-check` flag is present, a healthcheck endpoint will be exposed at `/_health`.
This implements the https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html[draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04]
specification. Any application error that occurs when sending a mail or generating a captcha will
result in a failing health check until the same operation succeeds again.

Note that the health check exposes error messages, which could potentially contain information
about the configuration of the service or parts of messages being sent. If this is a concern you
may wish to restrict access to the URL.
