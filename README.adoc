= Go contact form

== About

Provides a simple, tiny webservice that serves a contact form and sends responses
via e-mail.

image:example-form.png[Example contact form] ->
image:example-email.png[Example email message]

== Usage

The simplest way to use this is via docker:

    docker run -d csmith/contact-form -from form@server.com -to me@email.com .....

You should place this service behind an TLS-terminating proxy, and ensure it
is requested over a secure connection.

== Parameters

The application can be configured either using command line arguments
or environmental variables (shown in square brackets, below).
_from_, _to_, _smtp-host_, _smtp-user_, and _smtp-pass_ are required;
other options have vaguely sensible fallbacks.

----

You can use any SMTP server; however I recommend using a dedicated service
such as https://www.mailgun.com/[mailgun] or
https://aws.amazon.com/ses/[AWS SES], both of which you can access over SMTP.

== Templates

The form itself is loaded from `form.html` in the working directory; success and failure pages from `success.html`
and `failure.html` respectively. If captcha support is enabled, the captcha page is loaded from `captcha.html`.
Each page is loaded as a https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/[go html.template] and
can use the templating syntax described there. Forms must contain the `{{ .csrfField }}` template field, which
will automatically insert the CSRF token for the request.

Any query parameters passed to the form will be accessible through the `{{ .params }}` template field. The
default template will include all parameters as hidden fields in the form.

If the form contains a field named `from`, it will be used in the `Reply-To` header. Otherwise, no
special processing is applied to any field; they are all simply written out to the message body.
No server-side validation is performed.

When running from the docker image, templates are stored in `/templates`; you can
replace this with a volume to supply custom templates.

== Health checks

If the `-enable-health-check` flag is present, a healthcheck endpoint will be exposed at `/_health`.
This implements the https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html[draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04]
specification. Any application error that occurs when sending a mail or generating a captcha will
result in a failing health check until the same operation succeeds again.

Note that the health check exposes error messages, which could potentially contain information
about the configuration of the service or parts of messages being sent. If this is a concern you
may wish to restrict access to the URL.

Captchas are implemented using the https://github.com/dchest/captcha[dchest/captcha]
library, and most functionality utilises libraries from the
https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/[Gorilla web toolkit]. Health checks are implemented
using https://github.com/nelkinda/health-go[nelkinda/health-go].
